# Operator setup — refresh machine (Windows, direct access to celma)

The refresh machine needs: **Python 3.11+**, internet access to celma.org.cn
and github.com. No git, no VPN, no admin rights required.

## ⚡ Quick update & run (current: 2026-07-21)

If a run is active, stop it first: click its window, **Ctrl+C**. Always safe —
every fetched article is cached (writes are atomic), and re-runs resume.

Paste into a PowerShell window (plain cmdlets only — they ride the system
proxy natively, no login line needed; that also keeps them legal under
Constrained Language Mode, which may apply even interactively. If a download
fails with `(407)`, use the browser instead: open the raw URL, Ctrl+S, "Save
as type" = All Files):

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leyixu26/celma-lgb/main/src/transport.py" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\celma-lgb\src\transport.py"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leyixu26/celma-lgb/main/src/scrape_realized.py" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\celma-lgb\src\scrape_realized.py"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leyixu26/celma-lgb/main/src/scrape_schedule.py" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\celma-lgb\src\scrape_schedule.py"
```

Then run:

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\celma-lgb
.venv\Scripts\python run_all.py
```

(This box always lists the latest files to update — no ZIP needed.)

## 1. One-time setup (~10 min)

> **⚠ Put the project on a LOCAL path first.** On corporate PCs, Desktop /
> Documents are often redirected to a network share (UNC `\\server\…` or
> OneDrive). `cmd` cannot use UNC paths as a working directory (it silently
> falls back to `C:\Windows`), and venvs on shares misbehave — producing
> confusing pip/python mismatches. Use your local home instead: in Explorer
> paste `%USERPROFILE%` in the address bar and put the project folder there
> (e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\celma-lgb`); in terminals, `cd /d %USERPROFILE%\celma-lgb`.

1. **Get the project** (either way):
   - `python get_repo.py` (after downloading just that one file from the repo), or
   - github.com/leyixu26/celma-lgb → **Code → Download ZIP** → extract.
2. **Install dependencies** — in the project folder (type `cmd` in the Explorer
   address bar to open a terminal there):
   ```bat
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Corporate SSL error? Append:
   `--trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org`)*

   Then add the **optional China holiday calendar** (recommended — used for
   working-day lead metrics):
   ```bat
   pip install chinesecalendar
   ```
   If that fails for ANY reason ("No matching distribution found" on a corporate
   mirror, timeouts, SSL) — the wheel **ships inside this repo**, so install it
   with no network at all:
   ```bat
   pip install vendor\chinesecalendar-1.11.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
   ```
   If both fail, **just proceed without it** — the pipeline runs fully and
   falls back to a Mon–Fri calendar. Only `lead_wd` (working-day lead times) is
   affected, slightly overcounting across CN holidays/调休 weeks; the on-time
   test, coverage, and all amounts are date-based and unaffected. Runs in
   fallback mode print an explicit `NOTE:` so the basis is always visible.
3. **Create the publish token** (lets this machine push refreshed data):
   - github.com → Settings → Developer settings → **Fine-grained tokens** →
     Generate new token
   - Repository access: **Only select repositories → celma-lgb**
   - Permissions: **Contents → Read and write** (nothing else)
   - Expiry: 90 days. Copy the token string.
   - On the refresh machine, save it as **`token.txt`** in the project folder
     (the file is git-ignored and never leaves the machine).

## 2. Refresh — one click (two equivalent ways)

**Option A:** double-click **`refresh.bat`**.
**Option B (bat-free — use this if the bat window flashes/closes or policy
blocks .bat files):** in a terminal,
```bat
cd /d %USERPROFILE%\celma-lgb
.venv\Scripts\python run_all.py --publish
```
Both run the same thing: scrape → parse → **verify** (hard gate: any
completeness failure stops the run before publishing) → analyze → dashboard →
publish. ~15–40 min depending on how many new schedule PDFs exist. When it
finishes, the team dashboard is live at
**https://leyixu26.github.io/celma-lgb/** (~1 min for Pages to redeploy).

Interrupted? Run it again — scraping is resumable and the publish is atomic
(one commit at the end).

## 3. Fully automatic (daily)

Windows **Task Scheduler** → Create Basic Task:
- Trigger: Daily, e.g. **08:30**
- Action: *Start a program* → Program: `refresh.bat` in the project folder
  (set *Start in* to the project folder)
- Finish. The machine must be on at that time; a missed day is harmless — the
  next run catches everything (schedules post ~the 20th; results within
  3 working days).

## Corporate proxy (scrape times out: WinError 10060 / "connected party did not properly respond")

Your browser reaches celma through the **company proxy**; Python goes direct
and gets firewalled — note the realized feed uses the non-standard port
**4443**, which direct egress rules block almost universally.

Diagnose with three 30-second tests, then read the table.

**Test A — can Python reach normal port 443?** (terminal, project folder)
```bat
.venv\Scripts\python -c "import httpx; print(httpx.get('https://www.celma.org.cn', timeout=10).status_code)"
```
**Test B — can the browser reach the 4443 data feed?** Paste into Edge/Chrome:
```
https://www.governbond.org.cn:4443/api/loadBondData.action?timeStamp=1&dataType=ZQFXLISTBYAD&adList=&adCode=87&zqlx=&year=&fxfs=&qxr=&fxqx=&zqCode=&zqName=&page=1&pageSize=1
```
JSON text = 4443 reachable in browser; error/timeout = blocked network-wide.
(The browser may **download a file** instead of showing text — that IS success:
the feed's content-type isn't displayable. Open the file with Notepad; it
should start `{"code":"0","data":[…`.)
**Test C — the browser-level proxy** (`netsh winhttp show proxy` saying
"direct access" does NOT settle this — browsers read a different setting):
Windows Settings → Network & Internet → **Proxy** — note whether "Automatically
detect settings" is on, a **script address** (PAC URL) is set, or a manual proxy.

| Test A | Test B | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200 | JSON | 443 fine for Python; **python-on-4443 blocked** (process/port egress rule) | Ask IT: *"allow python.exe outbound TCP 4443 to governbond.org.cn"* — or run split mode (schedule at work, realized elsewhere) |
| 200 | error | port 4443 blocked for the whole network | same two options |
| timeout | — | Python has **no egress at all**; the browser exits via PAC or a security agent | see below |

**Fixes for the timeout case:**
- Test C shows a **manual proxy** or **script address (PAC)**: for PAC, open
  the script URL in the browser and find the `PROXY host:port` entries inside
  (Ctrl+F "PROXY"; the default is usually in the file's LAST `return` line).
  **Copy only the `host:port`** — drop the word PROXY, the quotes, and anything
  after (`; DIRECT` etc.), then prefix `http://`. Example: the PAC line
  `return "PROXY hkproxy.company.com:8080; DIRECT";` becomes
  `http://hkproxy.company.com:8080` — no quotes, no PROXY, no semicolon.
  Test each candidate directly, no file edits needed — use whichever prints 200:
  `.venv\Scripts\python -c "import httpx; print(httpx.get('https://www.celma.org.cn', timeout=10, proxy='http://HOST:PORT').status_code)"`
  The winner goes into `proxy.txt` as that single `http://host:port` line.
  Then create **`proxy.txt`** in the project folder containing one line, e.g.
  `http://proxy.mycompany.com:8080` — every script picks it up automatically
  (git-ignored, like token.txt); the run's first line confirms
  `using proxy from proxy.txt`.
- Proxy demands **username/password**: use
  `http://user:password@proxyhost:port`. Windows-integrated (NTLM/Kerberos)
  auth is not natively supported — ask IT for unauthenticated egress or a
  workaround.
- Test C shows nothing but a **Zscaler/Netskope-style icon** sits in the system
  tray: egress is per-process policy; only an IT request helps —
  *"allow python.exe outbound HTTPS to celma.org.cn and governbond.org.cn:4443"*.

### Once you have a candidate proxy — verify, lock in, run

Replace `HOST:PORT` throughout. These tests double as the "is the site blocked?"
check: any printed status number proves the path is open.

**1. Website through the proxy (~10 s):**
```bat
cd /d %USERPROFILE%\celma-lgb
.venv\Scripts\python -c "import httpx; print(httpx.get('https://www.celma.org.cn', timeout=15, proxy='http://HOST:PORT').status_code)"
```
`200` = proxy works, celma not blocked · `407` = proxy wants credentials — use
`http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT` (NTLM-only proxies won't accept this; ask
IT) · `403`/other = destination filtered (whitelist request) · timeout = wrong
candidate, try the next PAC entry.

**2. The port-4443 data feed through the proxy (~10 s):**
```bat
.venv\Scripts\python -c "import httpx; print(httpx.get('https://www.governbond.org.cn:4443/api/loadBondData.action', timeout=20, proxy='http://HOST:PORT').status_code)"
```
ANY number printed (200/400/405/500…) = the path works — this is the original
blocker cleared. (`405 Method Not Allowed` just means the endpoint dislikes a
bare parameter-less probe; the real scraper sends fully-parameterized requests.)
Timeout/proxy error = the proxy refuses CONNECT on 4443 → IT:
*"allow proxy CONNECT to governbond.org.cn:4443 (MOF public bond-disclosure feed)."*

**2b. Definitive test — run the actual production fetch through the proxy.**
Create `proxy.txt` first (step 3) — then no environment variables are needed
(`import celma` reads it in any shell):
```bat
cd /d %USERPROFILE%\celma-lgb
.venv\Scripts\python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'src'); import celma; c=celma.new_client(); d=celma.fetch_realized_page(c,1,5); print('total bonds on platform:', d.get('total'))"
```
Expected: `[celma] using proxy from proxy.txt: …` then
`total bonds on platform: 19xxx` = absolute proof — run the pipeline. An HTTP
`418` here would mean the platform's WAF is bot-flagging the proxy's exit
(unlikely when the browser works through the same proxy) — report it.

> **Shell trap:** `set HTTPS_PROXY=…` works only in **cmd** — in PowerShell
> (prompt starts with `PS`) `set` silently does nothing and Python goes direct
> (→ 10060 timeout). PowerShell syntax is `$env:HTTPS_PROXY="http://HOST:PORT"`;
> in cmd, no spaces around `=`. `proxy.txt` sidesteps all of this — prefer it.

### Still blocked through the proxy? (browser works, Python doesn't)

Two causes fit: the PAC routes these hosts to a **different proxy** than the
one you extracted, or the proxy requires **Windows-integrated (NTLM) auth**
that plain Python can't speak. Two decisive tests:

**T1 — fetch via the OS stack (same PAC + credentials as the browser).** Use
the blue **Windows PowerShell**. Note: `-ProxyUseDefaultCredentials` is not
valid without `-Proxy`, so either use the system PAC (variant 1) or name the
proxy (variant 2):
```powershell
# variant 1 — system PAC + Windows credentials
[System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials
(Invoke-WebRequest "https://www.governbond.org.cn:4443/api/loadBondData.action?timeStamp=1&dataType=ZQFXLISTBYAD&adCode=87&page=1&pageSize=1" -UseBasicParsing).StatusCode

# variant 2 — explicit proxy + Windows credentials
(Invoke-WebRequest "https://www.governbond.org.cn:4443/api/loadBondData.action?timeStamp=1&dataType=ZQFXLISTBYAD&adCode=87&page=1&pageSize=1" -UseBasicParsing -Proxy "http://HOST:PORT" -ProxyUseDefaultCredentials).StatusCode
```
`200` from either = the machine can automate this — **activate the built-in
PowerShell transport** (next). `407` = NTLM-only proxy (see ladder). Timeout on
both = deeper block.

> **Constrained Language Mode note:** if variant 1's first line errors with
> "property setting is supported only on core types in this language mode",
> the shell is in CLM — test the bare cmdlet instead (no login line):
> `(Invoke-WebRequest "…same URL…" -UseBasicParsing).StatusCode`.
> `200` means the same thing, and it is exactly how the pipeline's transport
> operates.

### PowerShell transport (activate after T1 = 200)

The pipeline can route every request through Windows PowerShell's
`Invoke-WebRequest` — i.e. the OS network stack with the system PAC and your
logged-in Windows credentials, the exact path T1 proved. No new software; works
under Restricted execution policy (inline commands, no .ps1 files); Task
Scheduler compatible; also carries the GitHub publish step.

1. Create **`transport.txt`** in the project folder containing exactly one word:
   ```
   powershell
   ```
   (git-ignored, like token.txt / proxy.txt. proxy.txt is NOT needed in this
   mode — the OS picks the proxy per the PAC.)
2. Verify — the definitive test again, which now announces the transport:
   ```bat
   cd /d %USERPROFILE%\celma-lgb
   .venv\Scripts\python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'src'); import celma; c=celma.new_client(); d=celma.fetch_realized_page(c,1,5); print('total bonds on platform:', d.get('total'))"
   ```
   Expect `[celma] transport: powershell (OS proxy stack + Windows credentials)`
   then `total bonds on platform: 19xxx`.
3. Run the pipeline as usual (`run_all.py`, then `--publish` once token.txt
   exists). Each request spawns a short PowerShell process (~0.5 s overhead), so
   a refresh runs somewhat longer than on an unrestricted network — fine for
   the daily scheduled task.

**If the verify step printed XML-ish garbage** (`…_x000A_…</Objs>`): that is
PowerShell serializing its console streams as CLIXML when run under a captured
pipe — fixed in the current version. The transport now returns the status via a
temp file (immune to stream serialization), forces `-OutputFormat Text
-InputFormat None`, and decodes CLIXML in error messages. Re-download the repo
ZIP, overwrite the folder, rerun the step-2 verify one-liner. If it now prints
a *readable* error instead of the total (e.g. something about EncodedCommand or
a security policy), send that exact text back — it names the real blocker.

**If it printed `ScriptContainedMaliciousContent`** ("script contains malicious
content"): the endpoint-security agent (AMSI) blocks *base64-encoded*
PowerShell (`-EncodedCommand`) — a pattern malware uses — and treats the word
"Bypass" the same way. Fixed in the current version: requests go out as plain
single-line `-Command` text, the same shape as the hand-typed T1 test that
passed. Only `src/transport.py` changed — use the single-file update from
"Updating the code" below, then rerun the verify one-liner. If even plain
commands get flagged, report the exact text — the next step is a curl.exe
transport (curl ships with Windows 10+ and can also use integrated proxy auth).

**If a scrape stops mid-run with a transport error** (e.g. realized "page 30
error … re-run to complete", or schedule pages erroring): sustained request
volume — especially the schedule list's 6 concurrent fetches — trips
proxy/EDR throttling; one-off drops also happen. Fixed in the current
version, three layers: every request auto-retries up to 3× with backoff
(drops/timeouts/5xx retry; hard 4xx like 407 don't), PowerShell launches are
globally paced ≥ 0.4 s apart, and schedule list concurrency is capped at 2
under this transport. After updating, just re-run `run_all.py`: the realized
feed restarts from page 1 by design (the full pull is the verified unit),
and all schedule articles resume from cache, so nothing is lost. If runs
STILL stop repeatedly, paste the error line (it now includes the full
reason) — the next escalation is a persistent PowerShell worker (one
process for all requests, no spawn storm).

**If it printed `…NotSupportedInConstrainedLanguage`**: the policy runs
*automated* PowerShell in Constrained Language Mode — .NET calls are blocked,
cmdlets are allowed (interactive shells run full-language, which is why the
hand-typed T1 worked). Fixed in the current version: the transport is pure
cmdlets — the system PAC routes requests on its own, with no .NET proxy tweak.
Single-file update `src/transport.py`, rerun the verify one-liner. Two
outcomes:
  - the total prints → done, run the pipeline;
  - `ERROR: … (407) Proxy Authentication Required` → the proxy wants
    credentials. Put the proxy address into `proxy.txt` (format
    `http://host:port` — the entry the PAC returns for
    `www.governbond.org.cn`, see the PAC-extraction section above). The
    transport then adds `-Proxy … -ProxyUseDefaultCredentials` (your Windows
    login, CLM-legal) automatically. Rerun.

**T2 — PAC host-specific branches:** Ctrl+F the PAC for `celma`, `governbond`,
`.cn`, `china`. A branch returning a different `PROXY host:port` for these is
the one the browser actually uses — test it with the explicit-proxy one-liner
and put the winner in `proxy.txt`.

**Workaround ladder:** ① T2 proxy in proxy.txt · ② PowerShell transport
(after T1=200) · ③ NTLM helper (`px`) if 407s everywhere · ④ browser-console
capture bundle (browser fetches, pipeline ingests offline) · ⑤ **file in
parallel regardless** — IT request: *"allow python.exe / proxy CONNECT to
celma.org.cn:443 and governbond.org.cn:4443 (MOF public bond-disclosure
platform, already permitted for browsers)"* · ⑥ fallback: scrape from a
celma-reachable machine, company PC consumes via GitHub (team unaffected).

**3. Lock in:** create `proxy.txt` in the project folder — exactly one line,
`http://HOST:PORT` (with `USER:PASS@` if step 1 needed it). Save as type
*All Files* so it isn't `proxy.txt.txt`.

**4. First full run — without publishing:**
```bat
.venv\Scripts\python run_all.py
```
Milestones: `[celma] using proxy from proxy.txt` → `realized page 1: 500 rows …`
counting to ~40 pages → `list … COMPLETE` → `amounts: … newly fetched` →
`ALL CHECKS PASS` → `DONE.` (~15–40 min; interruptions resume on re-run).

**5. Enable publishing:** create the GitHub token (§1.3) as `token.txt`, then
every refresh is `.venv\Scripts\python run_all.py --publish` (or `refresh.bat`
/ the scheduled task) — the team dashboard updates ~1 min later.

## Troubleshooting install

- **`No matching distribution found` for ANY package (curated corporate
  mirror)** — skip the package index entirely. The complete dependency set is
  bundled at **github.com/leyixu26/celma-lgb-wheels** (Windows x64,
  Python 3.12): download that repo's ZIP (Code → Download ZIP, same as this
  repo), extract, then:
  ```bat
  pip install --no-index --find-links C:\path\to\celma-lgb-wheels-main\wheelhouse -r requirements.txt
  pip install --no-index --find-links C:\path\to\celma-lgb-wheels-main\wheelhouse chinesecalendar
  ```
  `--no-index` means pip never touches any index — nothing left to block. For a
  different Python version, request a matching bundle.
  If it reports one specific package missing (e.g.
  `Could not find a version … tzdata; sys_platform == "win32"`), the bundle
  predates a fix — re-download the celma-lgb-wheels ZIP (bundle now includes
  tzdata) and re-run the same command.
- **Single package missing only** — for `chinesecalendar` the wheel is also
  vendored in this repo (see step 2); for others, retry against PyPI directly:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.org/simple --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org`
- **Timeouts from pip (to PyPI or GitHub)** — your browser uses the corporate
  proxy but pip usually doesn't, so pip gets firewalled. In order:
  1. quick retry with a longer timeout: add `--default-timeout=60`;
  2. route pip through the proxy (address from IT, or Windows Settings →
     Network & Internet → Proxy): add `--proxy http://PROXYHOST:PORT`
     (combinable with `--trusted-host …`);
  3. avoid the network entirely: the calendar wheel is vendored in `vendor\`
     (step 2), and any other blocked package can be browser-downloaded from
     pypi.org (its "Download files" page) and installed as a local file:
     `pip install path\to\file.whl`.
  Note GitHub *release* downloads come from `objects.githubusercontent.com`,
  not github.com — if that domain is blocked, use the vendored copy instead.
- **SSL / certificate errors from pip** — append
  `--trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org`.
- **pip says "Requirement already satisfied" but `python` says
  `ModuleNotFoundError`** — your `pip` and `python` are two different Python
  installations (venv not active in this window, or a Microsoft-Store/system
  Python shadowing PATH). Prove it: `pip --version` vs
  `python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"` — the paths won't match.
  **Fix: stop relying on PATH — name the venv's interpreter explicitly** for
  both the install and the test, so they cannot diverge:
  ```bat
  cd C:\path\to\celma-lgb
  .venv\Scripts\python -m pip install --no-index --find-links "C:\path\to\wheelhouse" -r requirements.txt
  .venv\Scripts\python -m pip install --no-index --find-links "C:\path\to\wheelhouse" chinesecalendar
  .venv\Scripts\python -c "import httpx, pandas, bs4, lxml, pdfplumber, matplotlib, openpyxl, chinese_calendar; print('READY')"
  ```
  Run the pipeline the same way (`.venv\Scripts\python run_all.py`) — or just
  use `refresh.bat`, which already calls `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` explicitly
  and is immune to this problem.
- **Project on a UNC / network / OneDrive path** — the root cause of most of
  the above: `cmd` falls back to `C:\Windows` on UNC working directories, so
  venv creation/activation lands in the wrong place. Move the project to
  `%USERPROFILE%\celma-lgb` (always local), **recreate the venv from scratch
  there** (venvs are path-bound — never move one), and reinstall from the
  wheelhouse. Results publish via GitHub, so nothing needs the network share.
- **`refresh.bat` window flashes and closes instantly** — never diagnose a
  flashing console by double-click; run it from a terminal so the error stays
  visible: `cd /d %USERPROFILE%\celma-lgb` then `refresh.bat`. Typical causes:
  no `.venv` yet (finish setup first), running a stray copy (Downloads/ZIP
  viewer/network), or corporate policy blocking `.bat` files. The bat is only a
  wrapper — the policy-proof equivalent is:
  `.venv\Scripts\python run_all.py --publish`
  (and Task Scheduler can call `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` with argument
  `run_all.py --publish`, *Start in* `%USERPROFILE%\celma-lgb`, no bat needed).
- **Wheelhouse path gotcha** — Windows "Extract All" wraps the ZIP in an extra
  same-named folder; the real wheel folder is usually
  `…\celma-lgb-wheels-main\celma-lgb-wheels-main\wheelhouse`. Navigate in
  Explorer until you *see the .whl files*, then drag that folder into the
  terminal to paste its true path. A correct install ends with
  `Successfully installed httpx-… pandas-…` (a long list).
- **Older download of this repo?** Early copies listed `chinesecalendar` as a
  hard requirement, so `pip install -r requirements.txt` aborted entirely when
  the mirror lacked it. Either re-download the repo, or install the core set
  directly: `pip install httpx pandas lxml beautifulsoup4 pdfplumber matplotlib openpyxl`
  and then follow step 2's optional-calendar instructions.

## First full run on the PC & first publish

1. **First round WITHOUT publish**: `.venv\Scripts\python run_all.py`. The
   first run rebuilds all article caches (~15–40 min through the PowerShell
   transport); later runs are incremental and much faster. It must end with
   `ALL CHECKS PASS`. Open `docs\index.html` locally to preview the dashboard.
   **What later refreshes fetch** (why they're much faster): article bodies +
   PDFs are cached in `data\raw\` — only newly published articles (~30–50 a
   month) are fetched. Two things are deliberately re-pulled in full every
   run: the ~80+ schedule *list* pages (completeness is proven against the
   site's 共 N 条 count, and celma backfills older-dated articles) and the
   ~40-page realized feed (old rows get amended / re-tapped; the full pull is
   what verify.py proves against the API's own total). Typical refresh:
   150–300 requests ≈ 5–15 min via the PowerShell transport. Keeping this
   incremental behavior is another reason to never delete `data\raw\`.
2. **Then publish separately**: create `token.txt` (§1), then
   `.venv\Scripts\python publish.py` — pushes the already-built outputs, no
   re-scrape. Publishing routes through the same transport; expect one short
   PowerShell flash per uploaded file.
3. **Safety net**: the pre-PC dashboard is archived permanently at
   `https://leyixu26.github.io/celma-lgb/archive/index_2026-07-21.html`, and
   the whole repo state is pinned by git tag `site-2026-07-21`. A publish can
   never delete files (it only adds/updates), so the archive survives every
   refresh. If a refresh ever breaks the live page, the archive is the
   reference and any commit can be reverted on GitHub.

## Updating the code (re-downloads)

- **Copy-overwrite, never delete.** Updates are a merge: extract the ZIP and
  copy its contents INTO `%USERPROFILE%\celma-lgb`, replacing when asked. Never
  delete the folder first — it holds machine-only files the ZIP does not:
  `.venv\` (all installed packages), `token.txt`, `transport.txt`, `proxy.txt`,
  and the raw scrape caches under `data\raw\` (losing those forces a full
  re-scrape).
- **`pip install` is NOT needed after a re-download.** Packages live in `.venv\`
  and survive overwrites. Reinstall only when `requirements.txt` changes —
  that will be called out explicitly when it happens. If ever unsure, rerun the
  install command: it finishes instantly with "Requirement already satisfied"
  when nothing changed.
- **Single-file updates** (when told only one or two files changed): no ZIP
  needed. In a PowerShell window — plain cmdlet only, works under Constrained
  Language Mode; do NOT prepend the old `[System.Net.WebRequest]…` login line
  (CLM blocks it, and the download rides the system proxy without it):
  ```powershell
  Invoke-WebRequest "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leyixu26/celma-lgb/main/src/transport.py" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\celma-lgb\src\transport.py"
  ```
  (swap the path for whichever file changed — the raw URL is always
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leyixu26/celma-lgb/main/<path with / >`).
  Browser alternative: open that raw URL, Ctrl+S into the right subfolder —
  set "Save as type" to **All Files** so it doesn't gain a `.txt` extension.

## 4. Renewals & upkeep

- **Token expires** (90 days): generate a new one, overwrite `token.txt`.
